Sign Outside Moon House: I am not at home right now. I know you are here searching \for a sleeping crystal.  I need a fire spirit for that spell If you get me one \then I can waive your fee for the crystal.
Sign: Heart should have a nice little stockpile that she uses for love positions, \so if you head due North you should be able to find her and get one for me. Thank \you in advance. - Moon

Flower: Hello! I heard you need some roses?
Flower: How did I know? Hehe, that’s a secret between the foliage and I. 
Flower: I need you to give me that singing fish that’s sitting in your \living room gathering dust if I’m going to give you those flowers.
Flower: You know the one. Go back home and get it. Quickly now! It’s almost \dark out and your mom will need her sleeping crystal soon!

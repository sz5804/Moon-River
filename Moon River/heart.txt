Heart: Oh hello. You’re looking for a fire spirit? That is easy enough for me, but \nI am afraid you will have to do something for me in return before I can give it \nto you. I need you to acquire a bottle of admiration from Star, east and across the river.
Heart: They are a total master of metaphors, something about “stars in eyes”. All I know \nis that Pen has been in love with them forever, that is why I need the admiration; to \nbrew a potion of confidence for him.
Heart: Do me a favor, don’t tell Star what it’s for, okay? I probably shouldn’t have \ntold you all that.
